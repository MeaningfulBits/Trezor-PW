Based On: https://github.com/trezor/python-trezor/blob/master/tools/pwd_reader.py

Simple How To
	- This python script decrypts a Trezor Password file
	- You need to set up the correct file/folder path for the tool to read from. Its currently set to dropbox.
	- You might need some trezor tools or plugins from the directory listed above.

Simple Explanation why this tool is needed.
	- This tool is needed by anyone that has used the Trezor Password Manager. Trezor discontinued its password manager which was used by a lot of people. This tool is currently needed by me and might be 
		needed in the future for development, testing, or archival needs.

Potential Replacements
	- Pairng a simple password manager like pass (unix) with the trezor key encryption/decryption should be a good alternative. not too sure how it will work as far as steps taken or if it will be 
		user friendly enough for the general public.

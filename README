Based On: https://github.com/trezor/python-trezor/blob/master/tools/pwd_reader.py

Simple How To
	- This python script decrypts a Trezor Password file
	- You need to set up the correct file/folder path for the tool to read from. Its currently set to dropbox.
	- You might need some trezor tools or plugins from the directory listed above.
	
	Running This Python Scrypt (See Sample Output)
	1. Install Current Trezor Packages
	2. Recreate file structure and copy pswd file to the correct directory.
	3. Run using (python3 pwd_reader.py)
	4. Input Pin and Passphrase
	
	After the credentials are put in correctly, the program should ask for a pswd file with a matching name.
	
	Tested on:
		- Debian 6.1.69-1 (2023-12-30) x86_64 GNU/Linux
		- trezor (debian package)
		- python3-trezor (debian package)
	
Simple Explanation why this tool is needed.
	- This tool is needed by anyone that has used the Trezor Password Manager. Trezor discontinued its password manager which was used by a lot of people. This tool is currently needed by me and might be 
		needed in the future for development, testing, or archival needs.

Potential Replacements
	- Pairng a simple password manager like pass (unix) with the trezor key encryption/decryption should be a good alternative. not too sure how it will work as far as steps taken or if it will be 
		user friendly enough for the general public.
